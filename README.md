# Archaelogical Predictions

The general idea for this project is to use predictive tools and models, and various statistical or machine learning methods to pin point the approximate locations of archaelogical dig sites near the Mediterranean Sea, or more specifically in the southern half of Croatia. Initial efforts lead to the exploration of the R programming language (R), Python and ArcGIS Pro as possible technologies and apps that could be used to predict the dig sites. However, due to the learning curve of R, and the inflexibility of ArcGIS Pro, the best choice was to go with Python for the modeling and data analysis. However, we kept ArcGIS as it enabled us to visualize the data and also use it to help wrangle with some of the geospacial data.
